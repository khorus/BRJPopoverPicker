/**
 A `BRJPopoverPicker` instance displays a popover with a list of items. The picker supports selecting one item from the list. Upon selection, the picker will hide itself.
 
 The picker must have a delegate object that implements `BRJPopoverPickerDelegate` and a data source object that implements `BRJPopoverPickerDataSource`.
 
 This class is iPad-only. Using `BRJPopoverPicker` on an iPhone will result in an exception.
